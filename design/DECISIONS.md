# Harbourly webapp design decisions

Decisions agreed during design that change or clarify the MVP feature list. Newest at the bottom.

## Ranks (feature list sections 6, 7 and 17)

- No official rank ladders are stored. Harbourly does not maintain tier lists for any game.
- Each coach game listing has one free-text field, "Rank or top achievement", about 40 characters, e.g. `Mythical Glory · 85★`, `Immortal 2`, `Premier 21,450`, `Regional Qualifier · Top 8`.
- The field is checked against proof screenshots at application review.
- When a live coach changes it, they upload a new screenshot; the previous rank stays visible until the team approves the new one.
- Shown in Geist Mono in a fixed position on the browse card and on each game section of the coach profile.
- Browse filters by game and price only; no rank filter. Sort stays: price, rating, most reviewed.
- Section 17's "rank stored as an orderable tier" is replaced by "rank stored as checked free text".

## Rescheduling (new, not in the feature list)

- Either party can request a reschedule up to 24 hours before the session start. After that the time is locked.
- The requester offers up to 3 one-hour slots from the coach's availability. Offered slots are held while the request is open.
- The other party picks one slot or declines. Declining keeps the original time.
- One open request per booking, and at most one accepted reschedule per booking.
- An unanswered request expires 48 hours after it was sent or 12 hours before the original start, whichever comes first. The original time stands.
- Payment stays held. Price and fee rates snapshotted at booking are unchanged.
- If a gamer declines a coach's request, the gamer chooses: keep the original time, or cancel for a full refund including the platform fee.
- In the sessions list the status stays `Confirmed`, with a `Reschedule requested` second line while a request is open.

## Emails

- Every reschedule and cancellation event sends an email to the people affected. Full email list to be confirmed.
