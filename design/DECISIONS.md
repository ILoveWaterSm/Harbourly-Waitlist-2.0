# Harbourly webapp design decisions

Decisions agreed during design that change or clarify the MVP feature list. Newest at the bottom.

## Ranks (feature list sections 6, 7 and 17)

- No official rank ladders are stored. Harbourly does not maintain tier lists for any game.
- Each coach game listing has one free-text field, "Rank or top achievement", about 40 characters, e.g. `Mythical Glory · 85★`, `Immortal 2`, `Premier 21,450`, `Regional Qualifier · Top 8`.
- The field is checked against proof screenshots at application review.
- When a live coach changes it, they upload a new screenshot; the previous rank stays visible until the team approves the new one.
- Shown in Geist Mono in a fixed position on the browse card and on each game section of the coach profile.
- Browse filters by game and price only; no rank filter. Sort stays: price, rating, most reviewed.
- Section 17's "rank stored as an orderable tier" is replaced by "rank stored as checked free text".
